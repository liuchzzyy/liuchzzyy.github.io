# Internationalization (i18n) Support

This project now supports bilingual content in English and Chinese (中文).

## Features Implemented

### 1. Language Toggle Button
- A language toggle button is available in the navigation bar
- Displays as "中文/EN" when in English mode
- Displays as "EN/中文" when in Chinese mode
- Click to switch between languages
- Language preference is saved in browser localStorage

### 2. UI Translation
The following UI elements are translated based on the selected language:
- Navigation menu items
- "Research Interests" heading
- Section titles (when using translation hooks)

### 3. Content Localization
Content files can have language-specific versions:
- English: `filename.ext` (e.g., `bio.md`, `news.toml`)
- Chinese: `filename.zh.ext` (e.g., `bio.zh.md`, `news.zh.toml`)

### Files Created for Chinese Content
- `content/bio.zh.md` - Chinese version of bio
- `content/about.zh.toml` - Chinese version of about page config
- `content/news.zh.toml` - Chinese version of news items
- `content/publications.zh.toml` - Chinese version of publications page config
- `content/projects.zh.toml` - Chinese version of projects

## How It Works

### Translation System
1. **Language Store** (`src/lib/stores/languageStore.ts`): Zustand store for managing language state
2. **Translations** (`src/lib/i18n/translations.ts`): Static translations for UI text
3. **useTranslation Hook** (`src/lib/i18n/useTranslation.ts`): React hook for accessing translations in components

### Content Loading
The content loading system (`src/lib/content.ts`) automatically looks for language-specific files:
- If a `.zh` version exists, it loads that when Chinese is selected
- Falls back to the English version if no localized file is found

## Adding New Translations

### For UI Text
Edit `src/lib/i18n/translations.ts` and add entries under both `en` and `zh` sections.

### For Content
Create a new file with `.zh` extension:
```bash
# Example: Creating Chinese version of resume
cp content/resume.md content/resume.zh.md
# Then edit content/resume.zh.md with Chinese content
```

## Current Limitations

Since this is a static site with server-side rendering:
- Content is loaded at build time
- Language switching currently only updates UI text and navigation
- Full content switching would require client-side data fetching or page reload

## Future Enhancements

To fully support content switching without page reload:
1. Move content loading to client-side
2. Fetch content based on language state
3. Or implement a build-time solution that generates separate pages for each language
